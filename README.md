# Yet Another Rust Hobby Operating System

A hobby OS (or so far just a bare-metal x86\_64 executable) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), mostly after _Writing an OS in Rust_ series at [os.phil-opp.com](https://os.phil-opp.com) by [Philipp Oppermann](https://github.com/phil-opp).

Such Project. Much WIP. `panic!("Wow.");`
